## About Me
I am a sophomore at UNC-Chapel Hill (Class of 2027), currently studying Computer Science and Business. My career interests lie at the intersection of software engineering and product management, as I enjoy solving complex problems through technology and understanding how software products can meet user needs. I'm excited to build on my skills and apply them in real-world projects, with a particular interest in developing efficient, user-friendly software.

## Skills

### Classes
I have taken several key courses at UNC that have provided me with a strong foundation in computer science. In COMP 110 (Introduction to Programming), I learned the fundamentals of programming, focusing on Python. COMP 210 introduced me to data structures and algorithims, the importance of memory management, and low-level software development. In COMP 283, I gained experience with discrete structures that form the mathematical backbone of computer science. Lastly, COMP 290 allowed me to explore tools and practices that are used in industry.

### Tools and Programming Languages
Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, VS Code, Docker, git
